# cs134
This repository is the homework for SJSU's CS 134 - Computer Game Design and Programming course. http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/catalog/courses/CS134.html 
Given the commands: 
  1) load this TGA file
  2) display this TGA file
and by in-class lectures, I built a game from scratch.
This means physics, sound, and visuals were all implemented by me. 
Sprites were used from https://www.spriters-resource.com/snes/yoshiisland/. Because of the low level TGA load command, sprite sheets needed to be cut down to individual tiles.
